# EventBusIJ_DesktopExample #

A simple example desktop application project using EventBusIJ, the simple Event Bus for Desktop and Web Edition Real Studio projects.

## How To Get ##

[Download, clone or fork from GitHub](https://github.com/ianmjones/EventBusIJ_DesktopExample)

For best results, please clone in the following way to ensure you get a populated EventBusIJ directory:

	git clone --recursive https://github.com/ianmjones/EventBusIJ_DesktopExample.git

GitHub's ZIP option will **not** do this for you as it will not include the EventBusIJ submodule!
